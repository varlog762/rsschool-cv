### About me:
I like programming (and everything related to technology in general). I worked as a system administrator for more than 10 years and decided to change my profession because I like to create something new and see the results of my work (that's why I chose front-end). I also like to travel, discover new interesting places, meet people and learn their culture - our world is beautiful. I love my wife very much, with whom we are raising a little funny cat together=)
